# Consul NMA Module

Consul NMA stands for Consul Network Middleware Automation.

The Consul NMA Terraform module generalizes service definitions to manage Consul
services across a number of network middleware services. This abstracts
provider specific management of load balancers and firewalls for a service.

The module is designed for a Consul NMA service to run in full automation.
There are files and Terraform variables that are autogenerated from templates.
