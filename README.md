# Consul SNA Module

Consul SNA stands for Consul Service Network Automation.

The Consul SNA Terraform module generalizes service definitions to manage Consul
services across a number of network infrastructure. This abstracts provider
specific management of load balancers and firewalls for a service.

The module is designed for a Consul SNA service to run in full automation.
There are files and Terraform variables that are autogenerated from templates.
