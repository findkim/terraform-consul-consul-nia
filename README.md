# Consul NIA Module

Consul NIA stands for Consul Network Infrastructure Automation.

The Consul NIA Terraform module generalizes service definitions to manage Consul
services across a number of network infrastructure. This abstracts provider
specific management of load balancers and firewalls for a service.

The module is designed for a Consul NIA to run in full automation.
There are files and Terraform variables that are autogenerated from templates.
